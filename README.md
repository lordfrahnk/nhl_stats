## The Project

The goal of this project is to highlight different methods of evaluating performance in the National Hockey League. From this, I hope you can learn more about what makes your favorite players and subsequently their team successful as they compete for the Stanley Cup. 

Additionally, hockey analytics is often presented in a way that can be confusing and challenging to explain. My goal is to share this information an approachable way so that anyone can learn and apply these concepts.

## The Data
The data was created by Money Puck and is available for download at this link: http://moneypuck.com/data.htm

I utilized their skater data from the three most recent NHL seasons. It includes the 2017-2018 season through the end of 2019-2020 season.

## Caveats
This project is focused on individual skaters only. A future state could include line combinations/defensive pairings as well as goalie data.

The 2019-2020 season was shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore has less game data than the previous two seasons. Keep this mind when comparing across seasons.
